# Saami social norms - analysis code
Code and data to replicate Thomas, Bårdsen, Næss (2018). [The narrow gap between norms and cooperative behaviour in a reindeer herding community](http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/5/2/171221). *Royal Society Open Science*.

Run the code in `run analysis.r` to replicate the results in our paper. (Note we use Bayesian models estimated with MCMC so your exact estimates might differ from ours.) Check the header of `run analysis.r` for a list of packages you'll need to install first.

Models and results from our most recent run of the analyses -- and those presented in the paper -- will be put in the `models`, `plots` and `results` folders upon publication.
