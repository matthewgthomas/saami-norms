# Saami social norms - analysis code
Code and data to replicate "The narrow gap between norms and cooperative behaviour in a reindeer herding community" (Thomas, Bårdsen, Næss - in prep)

Run the code in `run analysis.r` to replicate the results in our paper. (Note we use Bayesian models estimated with MCMC so your exact estimates might differ from ours.) Check the header of `run analysis.r` for a list of packages you'll need to install first.

Models and results from our most recent run of the analyses -- and those presented in the paper -- will be put in the `models`, `plots` and `results` folders upon publication.
